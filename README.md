You need **TWO** terminal windows/tabs for this (or some other plan for running two Node processes).

In one terminal run
```bash
npm install
``` 
Then run 
```bash 
npm start 
```
to launch the server.

In the other terminal, `cd` into `client`. Run 
```bash
npm install
``` 
then 
```bash
npm start
```
and go to `localhost:3000` in your browser.
